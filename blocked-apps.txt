# Every line corresponds to a matcher of an applications' command line
# that must be blocked. Matching command line matching gives more
# flexibility over name matching. '%' is used to match any string.
# For example if you want to block all instances of "foo.exe", you
# would add the following line
#
#     %foo.exe%
#
# Lines starting with '#' are ignored.

%skype.exe%
